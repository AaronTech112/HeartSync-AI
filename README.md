# HeartSync AI - Web3 AI Dating Platform

## Project Overview

HeartSync AI is a next-generation AI-powered dating platform built on Web3 technology. The platform uses advanced AI to represent users on dating apps, find compatible matches, and filter out dishonest users with its built-in lie detection engine.

## Key Features

- **AI Clone Personality**: Creates an AI that talks just like you
- **Lie Detection Engine**: Filters out dishonest users and red flags
- **24/7 Availability**: Your AI works even when you're sleeping
- **Emotion-Smart Chatting**: Ensures authentic conversations
- **Instant Soulmate Detection**: Matches your personality with compatible users
- **$HEART Token**: Native utility token for the platform

## Website Structure

The website is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a focus on modern design, animations, and user experience. The structure includes:

- Landing page with animated hero section
- Problem statement section
- Features overview
- How it works timeline
- Token information and distribution
- Roadmap
- Team section
- Email waitlist form

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with modern features like CSS Grid, Flexbox, and Animations)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Chart.js for token distribution visualization
- Particles.js for background particle effects
- Local Storage for email waitlist storage

## Running the Website

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser
3. No build steps or server setup required

## Email Waitlist Functionality

The website includes a simple email waitlist system that stores emails in the browser's localStorage. In a production environment, this would be replaced with a server-side solution.

### Admin Access

To access the admin functionality and export the collected emails:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+A` while on the website
2. An "Export Waitlist Emails" button will appear in the bottom right corner
3. Click the button to download a CSV file with all collected emails

## Customization

The website uses CSS variables for easy customization. Main colors and styles can be adjusted in the `:root` section of the `styles.css` file.

## Project Roadmap

- Q3 2025: MVP Launch with AI Dating Bot Alpha
- Q4 2025: Token Presale and Partner Integrations
